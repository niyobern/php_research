**Research Survey Management Tool**

---

## 📝 **Project Description:**

This project is a web-based **Research Survey Management Tool** developed using **PHP**, **MySQL**, and **Apache**, designed to demonstrate core web development skills in an academic context. The system enables researchers to create and manage surveys as part of broader research projects, collect participant responses, and analyze or export the collected data.

Built in a containerized development environment using **DevContainers** and **Docker**, the tool follows best practices in full-stack web application design. It integrates frontend and backend development, session management, dynamic form generation, and persistent database interactions.
