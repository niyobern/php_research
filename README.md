# PHP Research Project

This repository contains the **PHP Research Project**, developed as a practical product for hands-on experience with PHP web development.

## 📖 Project Overview

This application demonstrates a modular PHP web project, highlighting best practices in code organization and separation of concerns.  
It was developed as a reference implementation in a PHP course led by [@niyobern](https://github.com/niyobern).

## 🗂 Folder Structure

- `.devcontainer/` — Development container configuration for consistent dev environment setup. It can offer a fully-fledged environment in Github Codespaces or VS Code with docker.
- `config/` — Configuration files for the application.
- `css/` — Stylesheets for the frontend.
- `images/` — Image assets used by the application.
- `js/` — JavaScript files for frontend interactivity.
- `models/` — PHP files representing application data models.
- `views/` — PHP/HTML templates for rendering web pages.

## 🚀 Getting Started

You can spin up the dev environment right in your browser by creating a Codespace from github or if you prefer local development,
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/niyobern/php_research.git
   ```
2. **Set up your web server** (e.g., Apache, Nginx, or PHP's built-in server).
3. **If using VS Code**, the `.devcontainer` folder allows you to open the repo in a pre-configured dev environment.
4. **Access the application** via your browser, typically at `http://localhost/php_research/`.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- PHP 7.4 or later
- Web server (Apache, Nginx, or similar)
- (Optional) Docker & VS Code for devcontainer support
